	<h2>Education</h2><br>

    <p class="paragraph1">
		The modern education system in Bhutan was introduced in the 1960s under the leadership of the late 
        third Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. In the interim, a lot of schools and colleges were established.
        Back then, Bhutanese were happy with the level of qualification they received within the country and only those who excelled were allowed to study abroad. They didn’t know how to apply for either self or fully-funded offshore education. <br>

This gave light to the establishment of various Education Consultancy and Placement Firms (ECPFs) and with 
time it became prominent. People realized the need for further education abroad to enhance their knowledge and to become competitive across the globe.<br>
</p>
<p class="paragraph2">
Education consultancies help students who aspire to pursue higher studies. They help them make informed 
decisions on the choice of programs and colleges/institutes/universities outside Bhutan. The Quality 
Assurance and Accreditation Division (QAAD), Department of Adult and Higher Education (DAHE) help 
facilitate the establishment of ECPF. According to QAAD, DAHE as of 22nd May 2018, there are 38 ECPFs in
 the country. This blog contains information on 4 picked Education consultancies in Bhutan.<br><br><br>
